# 5G-Stock-Analysis

Technical Analysis - Stocks from US companies with ready infra structure to deploy 5G technology.

The objective of this project is to build a tool that helps small investors make decision based on technical analysis. 

The application will allow to choose between 6 stocks and compare it against each other to narrow down to one stock. Next step is to build a web page with drop down and searches that makes the process easy and quick to navigate.
